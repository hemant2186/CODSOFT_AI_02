# 🏆 Artificial Intelligence Internship at CODSOFT

## 🤖 Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

### 📝 Overview

Implemented an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. Used game theory and search algorithms like the Minimax algorithm (with Alpha-Beta Pruning) to make the AI unbeatable. This task enhanced my understanding of decision-making in game environments and basic search algorithms. 🎲

### 📎 Files Included

- **Tic-Tac-Toe AI.ipynb**
*Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation and sample runs of the Tic-Tac-Toe AI agent.*


### 💡 What I Did

- Developed a robust Python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with both human and AI players.
- Programmed the AI using the Minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible moves and select the optimal one for every turn.
- Incorporated Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve computational efficiency by reducing unnecessary move investigations.
- Automated victory, defeat, and draw detection after every move for a fair gameplay experience.
- Ensured the AI never loses — either wins or forces a draw every time!


#### 🎮 Sample Gameplay

| Human Move | AI Response |
| :-- | :-- |
| X in center | O in corner |
| X in top-left | O in center |
| X in bottom-right | O to block or win as needed |
| ... | ... |

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓


### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Gained practical experience with game theory and search algorithms in AI.
- Understood and applied the Minimax approach for turn-based perfect information games.
- Learned how Alpha-Beta Pruning optimizes decision-tree evaluation.
- Improved code structure for game logic and interactive play.
